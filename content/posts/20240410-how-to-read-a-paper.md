## Introduction

Efficiently read a paper is a critical but rarely taught skill.

Describes the three-pass approach and its use in doing a literature survey.

## The three-pass approach

The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

### The first pass

A quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of the paper, take about **five to ten minutes:**

- carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
- read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
- read the conclusions
- glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the 5Cs:

- Category: what type of paper is this?
- Context: which other papers is it related to? which theoretical bases were used?
- Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
- Contributions: what are the paper’s main contributions?
- Clarity: Is the paper well written

**think as a reviewer:** if a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper may be rejected.

### The second pass

read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs, take up to an hour.

- look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations
- mark relevant unread reference for further reading

### The third pass

Take about four or five hours for beginners, and about an hour for an experienced reader.

- virtually re-implement the paper

## Doing a literature survey

- Use academic search engine to find **there to five recent papers** in the area
    - read their related work
    - **a recent survey paper**
- Find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography
    - **download the key papers (1)**
    - find where the best researchers published recently
- Go to the website for these top conferences or journals and look through their recent proceedings
    - **identify recent high-quality related work(2)**
    - constitute the first version of survey from (1) and (2)
    - obtain key paper you didn’t find in these papers, obtain and read it
